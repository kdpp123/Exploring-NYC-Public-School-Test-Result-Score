# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Score
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.
Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.
This project analyzes New York City school performance data with a focus on understanding student outcomes in different subjects. The dataset contains information such as school names, boroughs, and average student scores in math, reading, and writing. The aim of the project is to explore the relationships between different academic performance metrics, particularly reading and writing scores, and to visualize the results.

Key Features of the Project
Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of school performance across boroughs and subjects.
Correlation Analysis: A correlation analysis was conducted between the reading and writing scores, revealing a strong positive correlation of 0.985, suggesting that students who excel in reading also tend to excel in writing.
Visualizations: Several visualizations are generated, including:
Scatter plots to show the relationship between reading and writing scores.
Count plots to display school performance metrics.
Correlation heatmaps to visualize the relationships between math, reading, and writing scores.

Python for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations.
